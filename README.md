## General Information
- Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis. It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
Data set used is day.csv


## Conclusions
- Total significant independent variables are 8: ['year', 'holiday', 'temp', 'windspeed', 'season_2', 'season_4', 'month_9', 'weather_condition_3']
